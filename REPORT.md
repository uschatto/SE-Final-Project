## The problem your bot solved


## Primary features and screenshots.


## Your reflection on the development process and project.


## Any limitations and future work.
The following are some of the features that can be added to out bot:

1) Currently, our bot takes care of files uploaded to the slack channel from local system. In the future, it could be made to analyse files uploaded from Google Drive/DropBox.
 
2) As we are using API's that are free, our bot cannot analyse images that are more than 5MB. To solve this, either a paid verison of the API can be used or a custom algorithm can be written to analyse image content.

3) When an inappropriate image is posted, our bot deletes the image and sends an email to the HR with the uploader's name only. The image is not attached as proof in the email. To solve this, images marked inapproprite can be backed up in the database. When an email is sent to the HR, the image can be inlcuded along with it.
