**PROBLEM STATEMENT**
1) There are times when certain files would not auto open and the computer might not be able to find a suitable application to open the files. Finding the right program to open such files can consume a lot of time. 

2) As an avid user of the Internet, I wonder how many times people move files from Downloads to a specific document folder to make it more organized or convert movies that are downloaded, to a specific playable format by your multimedia players. Basically, the Downloads folder can get cluttered with different types of files, folders, tar balls etc. It might not be easy to search or find a file. After a point, it gets difficult to manage and track all the files that are present. 


3) Files getting damaged and lost is a common occurrence and we have all experienced it. It could be due to system halts or hangs, accidental removal or some malware. In these cases, our precious files might be lost forever. When we try to back up the data in an external hard drive, we are again prone to the above mentioned problems. Also, while it's easy to copy files and folders to an external hard drive, it's also easy to forget. We might forget to back up data regularly and end up not being able to access it when we need to.
