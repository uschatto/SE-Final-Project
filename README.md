 (We had three different ideas and they are numbered as 1,2,3 below)
 
 
**PROBLEM STATEMENT**
1) While downloading files and viewing websites, we meet up with many file formats of which some are obscure and might need a special program to open it. There are times when certain files would not auto open and the computer might not be able to find a suitable application to open it. Finding the right program to open such files can consume a lot of time and it can be a little cumbersome when there is no effective method to get this done.


2) As an avid user of the Internet, I wonder how many times people move files from Downloads to a specific document folder to make it more organized or convert movies that are downloaded, to a specific playable format by your multimedia players. Basically, the Downloads folder can get cluttered with different types of files, folders, tar balls etc. It might not be easy to search or find a file. After a point, it gets difficult to manage and track all the files that are present. 


3) Files getting damaged and lost is a common occurrence and we have all experienced it. It could be due to system halts or hangs, accidental removal or some malware. In these cases, our precious files might be lost forever. When we try to back up the data in an external hard drive, we are again prone to the above mentioned problems. Also, while it's easy to copy files and folders to an external hard drive, it's also easy to forget. We might forget to back up data regularly and end up not being able to access it when we need to. 




**BOT DESCRIPTION**
> *WhatAnApp - Searches and installs the best app for a particular file extension*

    If you have used windows, you must be aware of the feature called "Look for an app in the Store". On encountering 
    an unknown file extension, the first thing that comes to our mind is to google what application can support this 
    file type. Very recent versions of Windows have off-loaded this task to do this search of an appropriate 
    application for you and provide you with the suggestions. After which you can go ahead and install that 
    application and set it as the default program for that file type.
    Our bot works on this idea where it keeps a watch on the downloaded file types, looks up the internet for the 
    best program to support it and installs the same for you without any manual intervention.

> *RuleItOut - Create rules to organize an otherwise disorganized directory*

    Remember the cool feature of Microsoft Outlook which allows you to create rules to move, flag, respond to email 
    messages automatically, play sounds, move messages to folders based on a certain criteria, or even display new 
    item alerts. Our bot will accept rules from the user and based on the same will organize a disorganized directory 
    such as Downloads folder. For example, the user can write a rule such that all files having file extensions such 
    as .png and .jpeg will be moved to a folder called Images. We can also extend this feature to remove or flag any 
    disallowed file types.

> *BackUPIt - Automatic backups of files shared*

    This bot will make regular automatic backups of shared files to the web services like DropBox or Google Drive and
    keep the data safe.Using slack as a platform, this bot will export files from private or public channels to these 
    web storage services.Users can chose which channels to include or exclude.Bot will also be customizable to set 
    periods for automatic backups.
