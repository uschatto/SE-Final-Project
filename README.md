**PROBLEM STATEMENT**
> *Sometimes finding the right program to open a file can be a little cumbersome. Or finding a better application to support a certain file
type can consume a lot of your time.*

> *As an avid user of the Internet your Downloads folder can get cluttered with different types of files, folders, tar balls etc. Managing 
and keeping track of all the files can get tiresome.*

3. Files getting damaged and lost is a common occurrence and we have all experienced it. It could be due to system halts or hangs, accidental removal or some malware. In these cases, our precious files might be lost forever. When we try to back up the data in an external hard drive, we are again prone to the above mentioned problems. Also, while it's easy to copy files and folders to an external hard drive, it's also easy to forget. We might forget to back up data regularly and end up not being able to access it when we need to.
